### I'm currently working on my Master's Degree in Quantitative Informatics. I intend to graduate this summer and hope to explore options for additional experience. I have been teaching mathematics for the several years and grew interested in statistics and data analysis. I am interested in investigating options to transition from teaching or using my experience teaching to merge these two subject areas.
